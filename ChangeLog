	- Bugfix: when tea was finished, click on icon -> icon ok, but
	  tooltip was still "tea finished"
	- added "Cancel"-button to menu, and can also cancel timer by clicking
	  on icon while running
	- showing remaining time not as "x.y", but as "xx:yy"
	- can configure arbitrary amount of teas, with custom name and time
