- beep() shouldn't use "special event" from "KDE system notifications",
  but define some own event? (and use own sample?)
- display times in Menu nicer (not in seconds but maybe just "nn:yy"?)
- somehow strip hours from KLocale::formatTime()-returned string
  in locale-respecting way
- some more tidying of configure-dialog
  (eg. initial size, don't stretch buttons)
- use QMovie for tea_is_finished-icon instead of two alternating pixmaps?
- display tea-menu on left-click? maybe on middle-click?
  (and offer "just cancel current" if already running)
- DCOP interface?
- have a closer look at i18n
- use KAction for enable/disable widgets?

- check for memory leaks
- make config-reading bullet-proof
- use "bubble" for tea-ready-notification (see Kopete)
