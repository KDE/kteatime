- somehow strip hours from KLocale::formatTime()-returned string
  in locale-respecting way
- beep() shouldn't use "special event" from "KDE system notifications",
  but define some own event? (and use own sample?)
- maybe use 2-column QListBox in config-window to display time next to name?
- some more tidying of configure-dialog
  (eg. initial position!, initial size, don't stretch buttons)
- display tea-menu on left-click? maybe on middle-click?
  (and offer "just cancel current" if already running)
- try to keep valid 'current_selected' index when shuffling tea-menu
- use QMovie for tea_is_finished-icon instead of two alternating pixmaps?
- DCOP interface?
- have a closer look at i18n-dos and -donts
- use KAction for enable/disable widgets?

- check for memory leaks
- make config-reading bullet-proof
