- bug(?): I haven't seen the icon being +animated+ for a long time!
  (something wrong with timer?)
  --> use QMovie for tea_is_finished-icon instead of two alternating pixmaps?
- remember geometry of config-dialog (and its QListView!)
  (or at least: x-maximize QListView's titles)
- somehow make double-click with left button start 'current' tea
  without displaying start_menu?
- add "custom time"-entry to menu -> popup small window for entering
  "anonymous" tea-name and -time
- try to keep valid 'current_selected' index when shuffling tea-list

- figure out how to use KAction for "quit"-entry of menu
  (somehow doesn't work as intended..)
- strip hours from KLocale::formatTime()-returned string
  in locale-respecting way
- some more tidying of configure-dialog
  (eg. initial position!, initial size)
- beep() shouldn't use "special event" from "KDE system notifications",
  but define some own event? (and use own "steeping"-sample?)
- DCOP interface?
- have a closer look at i18n-dos and -donts
- use KAction for enable/disable widgets?
- use XML-UI
- check for memory leaks
- make config-reading bullet-proof

---- new approach:

- make it a generalized timer-application
  (think: cooking spaghetti, watch TV-show, etc.)

  - This needs another approach to entering timeouts, since they'll often be
    needed just once -> eg. popup "Enter timeout:"-window on leftclick?
  - Must be able to run arbitrary amounts of parallel timers then!
  - Should be able to enter timeouts not just as seconds, but in any unit.
  - Allow periodical timouts (eg. "Take this medication every 2 hours")
    (if not clicked away, add count to window)
--> better start new application and let people migrate to it from KTeaTime
