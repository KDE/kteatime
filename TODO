- in configure-window: add "Execute: "-label in front of "action"-text edit
- nicer placement of "Configure events" button
- KNotifyClient: "Execute" not capable of %t substitution?
  (--> hence no replacement for my own "Execute: " action)
- KNotifyClient: passive popup cannot(?) have no timeout
  (--> hence no replacement for my own "Popup" action)
- when tea is steeping, the tooltip disappears too quick (after max. 1s) [bug #55103]
- when steeping, display "stop <teaname>" on left-click, not just "stop"
  (not easy when using KAction in a simple way?)
- bug(?): I haven't seen the icon being +animated+ for a long time!
  (something wrong with timer?)
  --> use QMovie for tea_is_finished-icon instead of two alternating pixmaps?


internals:
- 'int2time()' somewhere into class-namespace? (ie. not as global function)
- do kapp->closeAllWindows() on slotFileQuit() ?
- when in "ready"-state, left-click -> auto-go to initial state
  before opening left-click menu(?)
- remember geometry of config-dialog (and its QListView!)
  (or at least: x-maximize QListView's titles)
- somehow make double-click with left button start 'current' tea
  without displaying start_menu?
- figure out how to use KAction for "quit"-entry of menu
  (somehow doesn't work as intended..)
- some more tidying of configure-dialog
  (eg. initial position!, initial size)
- DCOP interface?
- have a closer look at i18n-dos and -donts
- use XML-UI
- check for memory leaks
- make config-reading bullet-proof


---- new approach:

- make it a generalized timer-application (with better UI than KTimer)
  (think: cooking spaghetti, watch TV-show, etc.)

  - This needs another approach to entering timeouts, since they'll often be
    needed just once -> eg. popup "Enter timeout:"-window on leftclick?
  - Must be able to run arbitrary amounts of parallel timers then!
  - Should be able to enter timeouts not just as seconds, but in any unit.
  - Allow periodical timouts (eg. "Take this medication every 2 hours")
    (if not clicked away, add count to window)
--> better start new application and let people migrate to it from KTeaTime
