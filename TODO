- save state of current_tea to config on every exit
- when saving config, remove remaining teas from config!

- beep() shouldn't use "special event" from "KDE system notifications",
  but define some own event? (and use own sample?)
- print name of currently preparing tea in tooltip
- display times in Menu nicer (not in seconds but maybe just "nn:yy"?)
- some more tidying of configure-dialog (eg. initial size)
- DCOP interface?
- have a closer look at i18n

- check that changing config doesn't influence current running timer
- check for memory leaks
- make config-reading bullet-proof
- better get 'teatime' immediately before starting timer, not
  when menu-item is selected?
