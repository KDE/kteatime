- create SVG icon(s) (or at least a 32x32 version for "About KTeaTime")
- Rename "shooting"
- Rename "Event" to "Notification"
- nicer placement of "Configure events" button:
  "Configure Events..." --> move to same line as "Event" and rename to "Configure..."?
  (and/or have a look at KStdAction::configureNotifications()!)
  (common is "Configure &Notifications..." btw.)
   [which gets translated in kdelibs.ps to "&Benachrichtigungen festlegen..."]
   [[more often, "einrichten" is used for "configure"]]
- use "readPathEntry()" instead of "readEntry()" (expands/replaces $HOME)

- have a look at memory consumption; seems too high for me..
- adapt kteatime.docbook to new century...
- save default time for "anonymous" to config
- in configure-window: add "Execute: "-label in front of "action"-text edit
- KNotifyClient: "Execute" not capable of %t substitution?
  (--> hence no replacement for my own "Execute: " action)
- KNotifyClient: passive popup cannot(?) have no timeout
  (--> hence no replacement for my own "Popup" action)
- when steeping, display "stop <teaname>" on left-click, not just "stop"
  (not easy when using KAction in a simple way?)
- use QMovie for tea-is-finished-icon instead of two alternating pixmaps?


internals:
- 'int2time()' somewhere into class-namespace? (ie. not as global function)
- do kapp->closeAllWindows() on slotFileQuit() ?
- when in "ready"-state, left-click -> auto-go to initial state
  before opening left-click menu(?)
- remember geometry of config-dialog (and its QListView!)
  (or at least: x-maximize QListView's titles)
- somehow make double-click with left button start 'current' tea
  without displaying start_menu?
- figure out how to use KAction for "quit"-entry of menu
  (somehow doesn't work as expected..)
- some more tidying of configure-dialog
  (eg. initial position!, initial size)
- DCOP interface?
- have a closer look at i18n-dos and -donts
- use XML-UI
- check for memory leaks
- make config-reading bullet-proof


---- new approach:

- make it a generalized timer-application (with better UI than KTimer)
  (think: cooking spaghetti, watch TV-show, etc.)

  - This needs another approach to entering timeouts, since they'll often be
    needed just once -> eg. popup "Enter timeout:"-window on leftclick?
  - Must be able to run arbitrary amounts of parallel timers!
    (difficult to use 'useTrayVis' then..)
  - Should be able to enter timeouts not just as seconds, but in any unit.
  - option for "popup reminder every X minutes"
  - Allow periodical timouts (eg. "Take this medication every 2 hours")
    (if not clicked away, add count to window)
--> better start new application and let people migrate to it from KTeaTime
