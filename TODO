- bug: in configure-dialog:
     1. select entry #1 (of 3)
     2. click on "new tea"
     --> "New Tea"-entry appears as new #4 (ok)
     3. click on "new tea" again
     --> "New Tea"-entry appears as new #3 (should be #5, no?)
- bug(?): I haven't seen the icon being +animated+ for a long time!
- remember geometry of config-dialog (and its QListView!)
  (or at least: x-maximize QListView's titles)

- somehow strip hours from KLocale::formatTime()-returned string
  in locale-respecting way
- beep() shouldn't use "special event" from "KDE system notifications",
  but define some own event? (and use own "steeping"-sample?)
- some more tidying of configure-dialog
  (eg. initial position!, initial size)
- display tea-menu on left-click for one-click select&start
  (above "Cancel current" if already running)
- try to keep valid 'current_selected' index when shuffling tea-menu
- use QMovie for tea_is_finished-icon instead of two alternating pixmaps?
- DCOP interface?
- have a closer look at i18n-dos and -donts
- use KAction for enable/disable widgets?

- check for memory leaks
- make config-reading bullet-proof
