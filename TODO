- bug: pressing "add new tea" in config-dialogue somehow corrupts one of the
  other teas and prints "New Tea" +twice+ in list
- KPassivePopup should stay indefinitely (cancelled by mouse-click)
  --> else look away from the screen for a few seconds at the right time,
      and my tea becomes tar...
- state of KCheckBox at "custom action" isn't saved to Config?

- somehow strip hours from KLocale::formatTime()-returned string
  in locale-respecting way
- beep() shouldn't use "special event" from "KDE system notifications",
  but define some own event? (and use own "steeping"-sample?)
- some more tidying of configure-dialog
  (eg. initial position!, initial size, don't stretch buttons)
- display tea-menu on left-click? maybe on middle-click?
  (and offer "Cancel current" if already running)
- try to keep valid 'current_selected' index when shuffling tea-menu
- use QMovie for tea_is_finished-icon instead of two alternating pixmaps?
- DCOP interface?
- have a closer look at i18n-dos and -donts
- use KAction for enable/disable widgets?

- check for memory leaks
- make config-reading bullet-proof
